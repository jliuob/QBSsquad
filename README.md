## Project Title: Analysis and Prediction of Global CO2 Emissions

## Description:
This is a data cleaning and analysis project on the “CO2 Emission by countries Year wise 1750-2022” data set from Kaggle. The preliminary data cleaning was done in Excel, and further visualizations and analysis was done in R. SQL code was also translated in base R to create visualizations and merge the two datasets. We started this project by noticing the drastic increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere that contribute to climate change. By analyzing, visualizing, and predicting the CO2 emission rate across different features, we want to present a broad view of how human activities affect the trend and show appeal for attention to one of the world's most pressing challenges.

## Prerequisites:
